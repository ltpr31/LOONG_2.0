LOONG (V2.0) is a software to construct auxiliary line based spatial trajectory (ALBST), which faithfully displays spatial relationships of spots along an auxiliary line.

Installation:

sudo dpkg -i /path/to/LOONG_V2.0.deb

echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/LOONG/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/LOONG/bin' >> ~/.bashrc

source ~/.bashrc

(note: LOONG fits Ubuntu 20.04.)

Functions:

Function "draw_a_loong" provides the interface to construct ALBST for simple tissue.

Function "draw_a_loong_protect" provides the interface to construct ALBST for complex multilayer tissue.

Function "draw_a_loong_edit" provides the interface to edit the color division image generated by function "draw_a_loong_protect".



Command example 1: draw_a_loong

draw_a_loong   \
--rootPath /path/to/root/path    \
--txtName position.txt    \
--imgName tissue.png   \
--outTxtPrefix albst   \
--ALBST_std 10  --outImg_height 500   \
--bgImg_height 1000 --bgImg_width 1000  \

--point_size  2


Parameters:

--rootPath: the path saving "position.txt" and "tissue.png", and the output folder is to be created here. (Required)
--txtName: the file saving coordinates of spots. (Required)
--imgName: the tissue image file. (Required)
--outTxtPrefix: prefix of the file to save ALBST values. (Required)
--ALBST_std: ALBST will be scaled to 0 to this value. If this is not set, ALBST will not be scaled. (Not required)
--Width_std: Width will be scaled to 0 to this value. If this is not set, the original ratio of Width to ALBST will be maintained. (Not required)
--outImg_height: height of image of rearranged spots. (Not required, default = 100)
--x/y_scale_factor: scale factor of x/y coordinates of spots. (Not required, default = 1)
--point_size: point size of spots displayed on the program interface. (Not required, default = 2)
--line_size: point size of auxiliary line displayed on the program interface. (Not required, default = 1)
--bgImg_height/width: scaled size of tissue image fitting spots. If this is not set, the original size of tissue image will be maintained. (Not required)


Operation steps:

1. right-click: draw polygons to select spots involved in ALBST. (Not required)
2. P key press: draw next polygons. (Not required)
3. middle-click: save selected spots in polygons. (Required, if 1. is carried out.)
4. R key press: save image of selected spots. (Required, if 1. is carried out.)
5. left-click/move: draw the auxiliary line. (Required)
6. left double-click: undo all actions. (Not required)
7. S key press: calculate and save ALBST values. (Required)

Parameters:

--rootPath: the path saving "position.txt" and "tissue.png", and the output folder is to be created here. (Required)
--txtName: the file saving coordinates of spots. (Required)
--imgName: the tissue image file. (Required)

--ALBST_std: ALBST will be scaled to 0 to this value. If this is not set, ALBST will not be scaled. (Not required)
--Width_std: Width will be scaled to 0 to this value. If this is not set, the original ratio of Width to ALBST will be maintained. (Not required)
--outImg_height: height of image of rearranged spots. (Not required, default = 100)
--x/y_scale_factor: scale factor of x/y coordinates of spots. (Not required, default = 1)
--point_size: point size of spots displayed on the program interface. (Not required, default = 2)
--line_size: point size of auxiliary line displayed on the program interface. (Not required, default = 1)
--bgImg_height/width: scaled size of tissue image fitting spots. If this is not set, the original size of tissue image will be maintained. (Not required)
--splitImg: to input the image file saving the colored areas, which was first generated by function "draw_a_loong_protect"/"draw_a_loong_edit". (Not required)



Operation steps:

1. right-click: draw polygons to select spots involved in ALBST. (Required)
2. P key press: to draw next polygons of the same group (in the same color). (Not required)
3. G key press: to draw polygons of next group (in next color). (Required)
4. middle-click: save selected spots in polygons. (Required)
5. R key press: save images of selected spots and colored areas. (Required)
6. left-click/move: draw the auxiliary line. (Required)
7. left double-click: undo all actions. (Not required)
8. S key press: calculate and save ALBST values. (Required)
